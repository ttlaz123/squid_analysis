        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This posting is mainly about the new set of squid plots to help us decide the best crosstalk-free SQ1 bias
            values.
        </p>
        <p>
            While performing comparisons of
            <a href="http://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/bicep_array/analysis_logbook/20230301_squid_screening/"> squid
                screening data </a>
            with the recent squid tuning data from
            <a href="http://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/bicep_array/analysis_logbook/20230412_L9_squid_tunning/"> L9</a>
            and
            <a href="http://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/bicep_array/analysis_logbook/20230413_L11_squid_tuning/"> L11</a>,
            it has come to our attention that relying solely on bias current may lead to mistakenly discarding
            functional
            SQUID chips. To address this concern, we explore the alternative of measuring device current. By
            assessing the current directly flowing through the chips rather than the total current passing through
            the MCEs, we can obtain a better understanding of cross talk in
            SQUID columns. In this posting, we compare the use of bias current and device current for cross talk
            analysis.

        <h2>
            New method of choosing bias points
        </h2>
        <p>
        <p>As explained in the <a href="../20230524_Squid_tuning_procedure">Squid Tuning Procedure (TR,SF,BAS)</a>
            posting, using
            SQ1 bias to determine the rowselect crosstalk is "biased". Device current, or SA FB, would provide
            better judgement.
            In the previous posting, (TR,SF,BAS) discuss converting SA FB into physical units for this purpose, and
            these physical units would be
            beneficial when comparing between different testing setups. Practically, we don't need the physical units
            for choosing
            SQ1 bias in SQ tuning. A benefit of using DAC unit for the new procedure is in its connection with the
            old tuning plots.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 2.1 is an example of the conventional SQ1 servo plot with RS on. The y axis is SA FB which is
            proportional to the Idevice.
            The device current is modulated with SQ1 FB flux which is the x axis of the plots. SQ1 bias is shown at the
            lower left
            corner of each panel in DAC unit. SQ1 servo is taken at different sq1 biases (sq1_servo_bias_ramp) for
            selecting the optimized SQ1 biases
            which maximize the peak-to-peak amplitude in the SQ1 servo plots. Similar data is usually taken with RS off
            to check for potential crosstalk.
            The new procedure will require the same sets of data, but instead of comparing the acceptible SQ1 bias in
            both cases, we now look at the
            device current/SA FB.
        </p>

            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The new plots for picking SQ1 bias are in Figure 3.2. The y axis is the SA FB with DC offset corrected [SA_FB
            - SA_FB(SQ1 bias = 0)].
            SQ1 min/max are the min and max SA FB in the SQ1 servo plots. The big red dashed cross marks the point where
            the peak-to-peak of the RS off SQ1 servo
            curve is a few times larger than the white noise level (RMS at zero bias). Here,
            we take the horizontal dashed lined as the crosstalk criteria. We need to select SQ1 bias for
            each column. The desired bias should optimize the SQ1 servo modulation, while keep the maximum device
            current lower than the crosstalk point
            for all rows.

        <h2>Squid Paramter Plots</h2>
        <p>
            We see from the plot below that some of the columns have multiple different
            optimal bias points. This is because the chips on those columns were sourced
            from different wafers, and thus have different paramters. Notably,
            Wafer 47 chips have a lower crosstalk limit, but they also have a
            lower optimal bias point to compensate. Thus, they can be used together
            on the same column. In the future, care must be taken to ensure
            that chips with similar paramters are placed in the same column.
        </p>
        <p>
            Converting from DAC units to physical units requires a set of
            relevant calibration parameters. Because we lacked the specific information,
            the physical units provided below, especially for the bias current, are likely
            inaccurate. They are shown to demonstrate that the calibration to physical units
            does not change the plots beyond a simple scaling.

                    Red/blue lines: row selects on. Dark purple vertical line
                    represents the amplitude of the maximum modulation when row select is on.

                <p>The dotted thick pink line is the
                    crosstalk threshold and marks the bias current and device current where
                    a column turns on even when all the row selects are off. This is a signature of
                    potential crosstalk. The small pink line represents the manually chosen bias
                    current to maximize the modulation while keeping the SQ1 Max below the
                    crosstalk threshold.

            Below, we sumamrize the measured values in a grid. The most relevant
            parameters are Ic_max - Ic_col, Optimal Bias - Crosstalk Bias, and Manually Picked Modulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ic_max - Ic_col </b>is the new proposed metric for determining crosstalk limits.
            In the grid, red indicates that the Ic_max is higher than Ic_col, which
            means cross talk is likely if the column was biased at the optimal bias for the row.
            Column 4 is especially problematic, as can be seen from the summary Ic Check plots:
            the green line starts to modulate much earlier than expected. There is structure
            in the coloring from the other columns; this is because different chips have slightly
            different optimal bias points, and thus different Ic_maxs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Manually picked modulation </b> reveals the modulation for each row at a bias point
            that was chosen to minimize cross talk. For column 4, because cross talk was
            prevalent at a low bias, it was necessary to choose a much lower bias point.
            However, this lower bias point does not yield significant modulation.

            In some columns, like 0, there is visible structure in which chips have
            higher modulation. This is because of the wafer sourcing discussed earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Optimal Bias - Crosstalk Bias</b> is the current method for determining crosstalk columns.
            This is a much stricter criteria that would lead to discarding over half of the columns.
            The structure that is appear in these plots is not due to wafer sourcing, but rather
            because of the unstable noise leading to different bias points marked as
            the crosstalk limit for the same column.
        </p>
        <p>In summary, red is <b>bad</b> for the following values: Ic_max, Optimal Bias, Ic_max-Ic_col,
            and Optimal Bias - Crosstalk Bias. </p>
        <p>
            Red is <b>good</b> for the following values: Ic_col, Best Possible Modulation, Manually Picked Modulation,
            and Crosstalk Bias

                    warmup and applying an RF shield around the cables, a significant
                    source of noise was removed, decreasing the modulation
                    when the row select switches were off. After warm up,
                    Columns 9, 11, and 13 were turned off due to heating issues.

            Device Current vs Bias Current Analysis
        </h2>
        <p>
            To better understand the difference between using device current and bias current for determining cross
            talk,
            we further explore the math.
            The current flowing through the squid chips depends on whether any row select switch is turned on.
            For a fixed bias current, the device current is higher when all the row selects are turned off, in
            comparison
            to when any row select is turned on. This can be seen in Figure 2.2, where the green/light blue line (row
            select
            off)
            is consistently higher than the red/blue lines (row selects on).
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand this behavior, we consider the squid circuit in Figure 3.1. Bias current flows in
            and out the points marked by SQ1BIAS. The entire circuit can be treated as a parallel circuit
            with three components, \(R_{shunt}\), \(R_{para}\), and \(R_{squid}\), where \(R_{squid}\) is the effective
            resistance of
            the squid chip itself. For the sake of simplicity,
            we assume that \(R_{para}\) is negligible. The device current \(I_{dev}\) is given by
            $$I_{dev} + I_{shunt}= I_{bias}$$

            $$I_{shunt}R_{shunt} = I_{dev} R_{squid}$$

            $$I_{dev} = \frac{I_{bias}}{1+R_{squid}/R_{shunt}}$$

        </p>

            <img alt="Squid Circuit Schematic" id="circuit" src="circuit.jpg" />

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            When all the row select switches are turned off, the squid chip is nominally superconducting, so the
            effective resistance \(R_{squid}\) is close to zero. In this case, the majority of the bias current
            flows through the chip, so \(I_{dev} = I_{bias}\). In reality, \(R_{para}\) is approximately a fifth
            of \(R_{shunt}\), so the actual relation is roughly \(I_{dev} \approx 0.85 I_{bias}\)
        </p>
        <p>
            However, when a row select is on, at least one of the switches is no longer superconducting, which
            increases the resistance of the squid chip to at least \(R_{series}\) (this value is approximately
            equal to \(R_{shunt}\) according to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665919">
                NIST</a>). This brings the value of the device current to approximately
            \(I_{dev} \approx 0.5 I_{bias}\). This can be seen in Figure 2.2, where the
            slope of the green line is roughly two times the slope of the red/blue line.
        </p>
        <p>
            This implies that when using the bias current as a marker of cross-talk, much more
            current flows through the squid chip than is assumed, sometimes as high as a factor of 2.
            While this strict requirement
            would essentially eliminate the possibility for cross talk, it potentially causes
            certain columns to be biased at a lower current than necessary. For chips that
            do not modulate at all regardless of the bias current, this is not an issue. However,
            a significant fraction of squid chips shipped by NIST has some cross talk at high
            biases, and these chips can still be used as long as their cross talk limit is
            higher than the optimal bias points.
